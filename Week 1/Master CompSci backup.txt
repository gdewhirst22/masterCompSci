autosave option:
in an API using NASAs API for example. Gets expensive to save each time as request to NASA each save.
Get blacklisted

topic 1 - binary and logic

binary conditions

logic gates: two inputs, one boolean output. true == 1, false == 0

(0,0) -> 0
(0,1) -> 0
(1,0) -> 0
(1,1) -> 1
AND gate

NOT gate
0->1
1->0

OR gate
(0,0) -> 0
(0,1) -> 1
(1,0) -> 1
(1,1) -> 1

NAND
(0,0) -> 1
(0,1) -> 1
(1,0) -> 1
(1,1) -> 0

EXOR
(0,0) -> 0
(0,1) -> 1
(1,0) -> 1
(1,1) -> 0

EXNOR
(0,0) -> 1
(0,1) -> 0
(1,0) -> 0
(1,1) -> 1

require A or B AND C i.e. A, !B, C
A, B, C,
 !A, B, C

else output 0

C1.

A or (B and C) or not D
i.e. 
A, all
!A, B,C, all
!(B or C), !D, all.

Challenge 1
A B C D
1 all
0 1 1 0
0 1 1 1
0 0 1 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0

Challenge 2

not (A or  B) means not A and not B

so all have 0,0 for A, B.

Require (D or C) i.e. all
Require not C
i.e. 
0 0 0 1

hardware and software
mosfets
CMOS is volatile 

transistors (mosfets) power delivery and regulation
correct voltage for each component
mosfets are easy to use and produce
PCIe lanes two lanes to send and receieve
CPU has a limit to the amount of PCIe express lanes it can support
I.e. more expansion slots for server farms, scientific research
 central processing unit

arithmetic logic unit - does maths and comparisons
control unit - coordinates activities. Turns problems into step by step instructions
and sends to the correct subsystem. It controls the systems resources

CPU
each core contains an ALU, CU and registers. More cores = more simultaneous tasks
clock speed = speed of core. Dependent on thermal limitations

RAM

peripheral devices are managed by the kernel 

Javascript
Dot notation
used by full stack developer
symbol -used as key for object when the property is intended to be private 

node filename.js

node is the interpreter which tells our machines how to understand javacript.
 We need to tell node to run the file so that it can be interpreted and then executed
